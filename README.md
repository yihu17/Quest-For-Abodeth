## To Do



### Bugs
- Can shoot behind you
  - Check the direction of the player and if the mouse is in front of the player before shooting 
- Spiders get caught on walls
- Holding down the left mouse button results in NullPointerException

#Enemies
- when hit set speed to 0 for 0.75 seconds
- attack player

#Player
- pickup weapons
- pickup ammo
- variables: health, ammo, weapons, currentWeapon
- store current weapon and weapons holding
- health when hit by enemy
- swap weapon (reapply damage stat if damage powerful in use)

#UI
- health (bar system) (simple integer property use for this)
- ammo
- mini-map
- all go in HUD packge

#Rooms
- doors interactable and move player to a different room
- CSVs need populating

#Graphics
- menus need creating
- pickups need making more clear what they do
- All weapons need overlaying on player
    - default weapons: machete & pistol
